Starting the AVALON-System
--------------------------

- Plug the Power-Source to the Device, it should boot by itsself.

    x   IF Power is already connected and green light is blinking
        Press Power Button for some time

- Wait until system is fully booted (2 minutes should be enough)

- Make sure the WLAN-Device is powered up and the right LEDs are on

- Start the controlling Laptop, connect to the avalon-Network and start a shell

- $ ssh castor@192.168.1.2
  login with the password

  From now on this shell is representing the ship-pc


Starting all the Programms (on laptop)
--------------------------------------

- Plug the joystick to the Laptop and wait at least 10 seconds

- Start another shell. This shell will be used for the laptop.

- Now you have to find out which device your WLAN card is. To do so type

    $ ifconfig

    In the output generated search for something like 'inet Adresse:192.168.1.xxx'
    where xxx is a 1 to 3 digit number. The name printed left of this block is the
    name of your wlan device. Usual names are 'eth0', 'eth1' or 'wlan0'

- Now tell the pc to use the route over the wlan

    $ sudo route add -net 224.0.0.0 netmask 240.0.0.0 dev xxxx
    where xxxx shall be replaced with the name of your WLAN-Device
    and confirm with your root password

- Next you start the store an the joystick driver

    $ store -catalog 192.168.1.2 &
    $ ddxjoystick -sample 0.01 &
    (if joystick is reckognised on an usb port, that has to be specified:
    $ ddxjoystick -dev /dev/usb.... -sample 0.01 &
    )

Starting all the Programms (on MainPC)
--------------------------------------

- change back to the other shell (the ship-shell) and change to the program directory

    $ cd gitdir/ssa

- to simply start all needed programs do

    $ sh remotecontrol.sh

- to stop all the programs

    $ sh remotecontrolkill.sh

These two commands should take care of everything. The commands below are not
needed ideally.

- start the flag-checker

    & ./flag-checker &

- start the remotecontrol interface

    $ ./remotecontrol &

- start the two ruddermotor controllers and the sail controller

    $ ./ruddermain -side left &
    $ ./ruddermain -side right &
    $ ./sailmain &

- Test if all works fine

    x IF you want to have direct feedback of the sail and rudder angles
      kill the remotecontrol and restart it. (this shouldn't be done be-
      fore starting the motor-drivers, because it blocks the shell...)

      $ su
        login with the password

      $ killall remotecontrol
      $ exit
      $ ./remotecontrol -talk 1

- Thats it.
