The project is very interesting and with good matching to the scope of
the Magazine.
However, some modification needs before publication.
1)	The title is not adequate to the content because the paper
describe a project, not only the guidance and control aspects; please
change the title;
2)	In part IV C the identification of the parameters of the model,
based on true data, is missed. As the model is used for tuning the
regulators, an accurate identification stage of the model necessary;
3)	In part IV E please indicate clearly which results are in
simulation and which are from experiments. Moreover, tables with PID
parameters tuned from simulation and from real experiments can both
reported in order to verify the goodness of the identified model;
4)	Reading parts IV and V is, some times, confusing. Part IV and V
could be reorganized in tree main parts: Navigation (sensor data fusion
and localization), Guidance (path planning) and Control (trajectory
tracking);
5)	It is very important that you report in the paper more
experiments than that actually reported;
6)	There are some incomplete references. Please check it
carefully.
