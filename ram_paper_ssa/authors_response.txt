Dear Prof. Marani,

thank you for the helpful reviews.

We have modified the paper considering all the comments. We especially
reorganised the section order, to make understanding of the interaction between
the software parts easier and to make the text more consistent. Also, we
extended the review of existing literature, comparing our boat to the existing
ones. Furthermore, the experimental results were updated and extended with the
later developments and some unclear parts are further explained.

We think that these modifications make understanding of the material easier and
add more value to the paper.

With kind regards
Hendrik Erckens
